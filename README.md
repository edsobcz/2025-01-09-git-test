- `git clone`: does a one-time download from github to your local computer
  - make sure the directory you are cloning is not already a git repository (nesting is annoying)

- `git status`: tells you everything you need to know about your github repo (including whether you're in a github repo)

- `git add`: adds the file to the staging area and readies it for committing

- `git commit -m "message here"`: commits the added files with the commit message in quotes
